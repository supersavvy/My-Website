                        <h4>
                           <p> Girls Who Code was life-changing for me. I learned the basics of Python, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other important languages. I had the opportunity to attend important tech events like the CybHer Security Conference at Stanford University, and explore prominent technical companies, including: Juniper Networks, GoodReads, Twitch, and multiple branches of Amazon like Amazon Web Services and Lab126.</p>
                           <p>Before this program, I didn't think that I was cut out to be a programmer, much less be involved with computer science at all. Girls Who Code helped me discover that coding is always logical, and if you work hard enough, you can create whatever you want (like this website - coded in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS!). Thank you Girls Who Code, for the unforgettable experiences.

I write frequently for all three columns, and am also the head for the weekly "Breaking News" segment, one of our main features.</p>
                           <p>Many people told me that an internship for an online magazine didn't really fit into my story, but they couldn't have been more wrong. I am truly passionate about spreading important knowledge, and empowering young women all around me.</p>

I've won top speaker and advanced to late in the elimination rounds at many tournmanets as well, including Santa Clara University and the JV Western Championships.</p>
                           I also try to give back to my team as much as possible. I dedicate afterschool on Monday every week to judging practice rounds and giving topic lectures to our novice debaters, so that our team can continue to be the best around.
